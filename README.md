# A Little About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @mlja0408
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot. Primarily production and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, & Node JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that, as a beginner, you will be patient with me on, as I am still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me GitHub would be the best way to reach me. I'm not sure if there is a way to on here, or if I'll have to put a public email address out.
